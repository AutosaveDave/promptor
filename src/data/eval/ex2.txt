College Service:

In the category of College Service, [Name] exceeds expectations. [Name] brings a perspective to the college that is both needed and laudable. His experience working here as an advisor, director, and his length of employment are invaluable. Accordingly, he maintains active relationships with people from across the college and actively engages in many areas of college service to support the institution.  While his experiences volunteering have varied over the years, [Name] continues to find ways to engage in improving the department and the Bristol community as a whole. 

In the past year, [Name] has continued to serve as the liaison to STEM division 5, to work on an agreement with Beltei university in Cambodia with the president of the College,  to support additional SAP calculations, and to serve on two departmental workgroups to improve the department. [Name] cares deeply about the institution and has been invaluable in supporting the overall culture of the advising department.  He’s even speaking to a college class about his experiences and they are reading his book as required reading. 

Work Performance Evaluation:

Overall, [Name] meets and often exceeds expectations in the category of work performance.  He’s a prompt communicator, he’s active when on drop-ins, supports new ideas, and is student focused and driven. During our staff retreat this year, Manka invested in the new staff by educating everyone on how things have changed and what the history of the department has been.  [Name]’s a warm presence for staff as well; his office is often full of staff from this department – and others – during the lunch times. His positive investment in his work is evident in his staff relationships and his workplace demeanor. 

[Name] is a caring advisor; he prepares for his advising appointments by not just trying to understand the student logistics but also the rationale behind student decision. He personally wants students to feel successful at Bristol and it shows in his work. During his advising appointments, he’s detail oriented and uses his advising knowledge to provide well-informed suggestions on course selections. He is a great referral resource and is eager to connect students with appropriate follow-ups. He share about his life, and his children, in a way that inspires students to reach for more, and for them to connect with him outside of his role. 

[Name] embraces elements of relational advising, has great customer service skills, and is fantastic at providing accurate advisement. A good goal for [Name], for the next year, would be to utilize EAB as a new tool to improve his case management approach. As newer students are assigned to him that he will be able to keep as his assigned advisee; a great goal would be to focus on repeat appointments for the students that he identifies as needing more support. [Name] doesn’t hesitate to provide life advice to students when appropriate; I’m excited for how Navigate will create more opportunities for our students to benefit from this life advice.
